# PowerNX Docs
These articles are meant to cover the topics of electrical and electronic engineering in detail. They will start off by articles on mathematics backgrounds and build up to more advanced and real-world applications of EE.

## Articles
1. [Logarithm and exponential functions.](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/1_Logarithm_and_exponential_functions.pdf)
*The math behind exponentials and how they appear in circuit analysis*
2. [RMS value and boilerplate C++ classes](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/2_Rms_and_boilerplate_cpp_classes.pdf)
*The concept of root mean square (rms) and the reason we define it for AC signals. We also implement some boilerplate C++ classes to work with electrical signals in our projects* 
3. AC circuits and phasor diagram -
*The circuits consist of AC Sources and also phasor diagram for representing sinusoidal functions*
4. [Transformers](https://github.com/blackreach/docs/releases/download/v0.1.1/4_Transformers.pdf)
*The basics of single-phase transformers and the reason it's used in power transmission.*
5. TBD
