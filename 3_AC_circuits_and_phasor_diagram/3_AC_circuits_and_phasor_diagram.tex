	\begin{abstract}
	A wide range of electrical circuits consist of AC sources.
	A prime example is the ones that consist of \textit{generators};
	Since most of these devices typically get advantage of rotational magnetic fields hence producing sinusoidal electrical power.
	In this article we take a look at the calculations of these circuits.

	\section{AC Circuits}
	Let's start with a simple case: A circuit that consists of a sinusoidal AC voltage source series with a resistor.
